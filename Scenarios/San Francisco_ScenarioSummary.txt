base: Delta is 50% more transmissible than Alpha, no increase in severity over Alpha, no waning immunity
epiOptimistic: Delta is 40% more transmissible than Alpha, no increase in severity over Alpha, no waning immunity
epiPessimistic: Delta is 60% more transmissible than Alpha, hospitalization rate twice Alpha, waning immunity
All scenarios: vaccine uptake 85% in 12-64, 93% in 65+; age 0-11 eligible Jan 1; Delta 30% on June 15 and dominant by July
