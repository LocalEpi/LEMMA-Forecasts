base: Delta is 50% more transmissible than Alpha, no increase in severity over Alpha, no waning immunity, 10% increase in effective contact rate on June 15, current vaccine uptake
epiOptimistic: Delta is 40% more transmissible than Alpha, no increase in severity over Alpha, no waning immunity
epiPessimistic: Delta is 60% more transmissible than Alpha, hospitalization rate twice Alpha, waning immunity
