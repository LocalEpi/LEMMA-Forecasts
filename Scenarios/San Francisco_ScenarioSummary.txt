base: Delta is 50% more transmissible than Alpha, no increase in severity over Alpha, waning immunity, 10% increase in effective contact rate on June 15, current vaccine uptake
epiOptimistic: Delta is 40% more transmissible than Alpha, no increase in severity over Alpha, no waning immunity
epiPessimistic: Delta is 60% more transmissible than Alpha, hospitalization rate twice Alpha, waning immunity
reopenInc5: 5% increase in effective contact rate on June 15
reopenInc10: 10% increase in effective contact rate on June 15
reopenInc20: 20% increase in effective contact rate on June 15
uptake85: 85% vaccine uptake in 12-64
